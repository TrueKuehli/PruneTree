      <h1>Publish Your Tree</h1>
      <p>
        This guide takes you through how to make your trees public and share them in the gallery.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you publish a tree it will be a copy of the tree as it is at the time it was published.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you make changes in the tree editor these changes won't show in your published tree
        until you re-publish it.
      </p>

      <h2>Make Your Tree Public</h2>
      <p>
        In the tree editor toolbar go to <strong>Actions</strong> and select <strong>Publish Tree</strong> to
        open the publish tree view.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this page should be a note to say what URL your published tree will be at.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enable the switch for <strong>Is Public</strong> and click <strong>Save</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only people who you share the public link with will have access to your tree.

        to open the publish tree view.

        You can unpublish your tree or remove it from the gallery by going to <strong>Actions</strong> and
        select <strong>Publish Tree</strong> from the tree editor toolbar.
      </p>
      <p>
        While in the publish tree view simply disable the switches as desired.
