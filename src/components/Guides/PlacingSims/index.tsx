      <h1>Placing Sims in Your Tree</h1>
      <p>
        Sims and tree structures are two separate things in The Prune Tree so once you've added some Sims
        you'll want to master how place them to form a tree.
      </p>
      <div className='side-note'>
        Remember you'll have to have already created your Sims before you can place them in a tree
      </div>

      <h2>Add Your Sim</h2>
      <p>
        To set the Sim for a node click the <strong>Wrench Icon</strong> on a node.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click <strong>Set This Nodes Person</strong> and select one of you Sims from the dropdown.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Add partner rows using the <strong>Add Partner</strong> button. These will be displayed above each other
        to the right of the Node person.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can add multiple Sims into each partner row you add. These will display to the right of
        each previous partner in that row.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's up to you how you organise a node partners. Some people use multiple partners in a row to show
        a partners other partners. Others use it when a lots of partners take up too much space above each other.
      </p>

        by the tree itself.
