      <h1>The Tree Editor</h1>
      <p>
        Once you've created your tree before you dive in make sure you're familiar with the tree editor.
        Get to know it, take it out for dinner, live a long and happy life together or something along those lines.
      </p>

      <h2>The Tree Editor Toolbar</h2>
      <img src={toolbarGif} alt="Image showcasing the editor toolbar" width='100%' />
      <p>
        The tree editor toolbar lets you get to many areas when it comes to editing your tree.
      </p>

      <h3>Actions - Save Tree</h3>
      <p>
        Under <strong>Actions</strong> you can save your tree. The prune tree auto saves as you modify your tree
        but this lets you be certain everything is saved. A success message will appear to confirm the save.
      </p>

      <h3>Actions - Publish Tree</h3>
      <p>
        Under <strong>Actions</strong> when you click <strong>Publish Tree</strong> you'll be given the options
        to make your tree public and if you want it listed in the gallery.
      </p>
      <p>
        We go into more details of this in the guide Publish Your Tree.
      </p>

      <h3>Actions - Delete Tree</h3>
      <p>
        If you no longer want a tree you can delete it. You'll be asked to confirm if you want to delete a tree
        in case you click this option accidentally.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a tree is public or in the gallery these copies will still remain unless you unpublish your tree
        before you delete it.
      </p>

      <h3>Edit - Tree Details</h3>
      <p>
        Under <strong>Edit</strong> you can update the tree details you entered when you first created your tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are things such as the trees title, description or cover image which are all shown in
        the tree info pane and gallery if the tree is published there.
      </p>

      <h3>Edit - People in Tree</h3>
      <p>
        Before you start creating your trees links between sims, their children, parents and partners
        you'll need to have some Sims at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Going to <strong>Edit</strong> and selecting <strong>People in Tree</strong> takes you to the
        people manager where you can add, edit or delete people you will be placing in yur tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        The guide <strong>Adding/Editing Sims</strong> goes into more details on what you can do there and how.
      </p>

      <h3>Preview Mode</h3>
      <p>
        You can toggle preview mode which will hide any buttons in the tree below the toolbar to show you how
        a tree will look once published.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember to turn it off to be able to continue to edit the trees structure.
      </p>

      <h2>The Tree Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The Prune Tree separates the Sims and the structure of your trees into two separate concepts.
        You'll create some Sims and you'll also create a structure that shows the links between parents and children.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then you'll place the Sims you created into the structure you created to form a family tree.
      </p>
      <img src={treeNode} alt="Image showcasing a Tree Node" width='150'
           style={{margin: '0px auto', display: 'block'}} />
      <p>
        When you first create a tree below the toolbar you'll see a single empty <strong>Node</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of a <strong>Node</strong> as a point in a tree where you'll add a Sim and their partners.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Nodes</strong> below this one signify the children of the Sim and their partner(s) above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each <strong>Nodes</strong> has two buttons. The one to the left showing the wrench lets you add details to
        the <strong>Node</strong> such as the Sim, their partners, and details about how the sim of
        the <strong>Node</strong> was conceived by their parents (i.e. were they adopted, cloned, or result
        of alien abduction ðŸ‘½).
      </p>
      <p>
        The button below allows you to add child <strong>Nodes</strong>, each you can setup in the same was as
        the initial <strong>Node</strong> by clicking the wrench for that child.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can keep adding as many child <strong>Nodes</strong> to any depth as you need. Just remember you'll need
        to create the Sims you want to put in a <strong>Node</strong> beforehand.
