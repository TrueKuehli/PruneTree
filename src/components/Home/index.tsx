          <p>Welcome to the Prune Tree app!</p>
          <p>Create dynamic family trees for your sims legacies.</p>
          <p>
            A <Link to='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)'>fork</Link> of the
            <Link to='https://gitlab.com/plum-tree'>Plum Tree</Link> app, based on the original source code and
            available on <Link to='https://github.com/TrueKuehli/PruneTree'>GitHub</Link>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This fork was created after the shutdown of the website hosting the original app. The goal of this fork
            is to provide a way to track family trees to the Sims community that looks and feels familiar,
            yet does not require a server for storing and managing trees.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a consequence of now storing trees locally, there currently is no way to share trees with other people.
            This will be somewhat improved by better download options in a future version.
          </p>
